# Swing-It-
Submitted for LA Hacks 2019.
It is a First-Person action game. Player can swing around levels like Spider-Man. There are three levels. The player need to complete different mission in each one of them.

### How We built it
We used Unity and C#.

### Challenges We ran into
We had two major problems. First, we had trouble of implementing mechanical movement. Seoncd, we had trouble of adding more functionalities. We used a different way to achieve the swing motion, which made the whole project hard to add more features .  

### Accomplishments that We're proud of
We are proud that the game physics is functional and that our player can swing through the level.

### What We learned
We learned a lot about Unity 3D, C#, and teamwork especially under extreme time limit.
